Hello‚úåÔ∏è, I'm Mardochee!

Data Scientist

Welcome to my data science portfolio. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science at Bellevue University while working as a Service Center Support at FedEx Freight. In my role at FedEx Freight, I support the daily operations of the facility and ensure compliance with safety and quality standards.
With my Bachelor's degree in data science, I aim to leverage my analytical skills and expertise in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning to effectively utilize diverse datasets and extract actionable insights.

This portfolio summarizes the projects I have completed as part of my assignments during my curriculum at Bellevue University. Each project showcases my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and domain expertise in data science. Through these projects, I have applied theoretical knowledge to practical problems, demonstrating my capability to handle real-world data science challenges.
